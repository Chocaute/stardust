The header files define an interface: they specify how the functions in the source file are defined.

They are used so that a compiler can check if the usage of a function is correct as the function signature (return value and parameters) is present in the header file. For this task the actual implementation of the function is not necessary.

You could do the same with the complete kernel sources but you will install a lot of unnecessary files.

Example: if I want to use the function

```
int foo(double param);
```

in a program I do not need to know how the implementation of `foo` is, I just need to know that it accepts a single param (`double`) and returns an integer.

Header files are used to define interfaces between components of the kernel and between the kernel and user space. They are used to specify how functions in the source file are defined. When a program is compiled, the compiler checks if the usage of a function is correct by looking at its signature in the header file. The actual implementation of the function is not necessary for this task .

Header files are also used to make code more portable. By including header files, you can use functions and variables that are defined in other files without having to copy and paste the code into your own file. This makes it easier to write code that can be compiled on different systems .

Linux headers are files that contain information about how to communicate with the Linux operating system. They are used by other programs to interact with the kernel. Think of them as a dictionary that helps other programs understand how to use the kernel. The header files are used to compile device drivers or other loadable modules that link into the kernel.

Linux headers, often referred to as "kernel headers," are source code files and header files that provide the necessary information and interfaces for writing and compiling programs that interact with the Linux kernel. These headers contain definitions, data structures, and function prototypes that allow user-level programs, such as device drivers and system utilities, to communicate with the kernel and make system calls.

Here are some key points about Linux headers:

1. **Kernel Interface**: The Linux kernel provides a set of system calls and functions that user-level programs can use to interact with the underlying operating system. These headers define the interface between user-space and kernel-space, allowing applications and kernel modules to communicate effectively.
    
2. **Portability**: Linux headers are crucial for portability because they abstract the underlying hardware and kernel details. When you compile a program or a kernel module, it relies on these headers to ensure compatibility across different kernel versions and hardware architectures.
    
3. **Development**: Kernel headers are essential for developers who want to create device drivers, system utilities, or other software that interacts with the kernel. They provide the necessary constants, data structures, and function prototypes required for kernel interaction.
    
4. **Kernel Module Compilation**: When you build a kernel module, you typically include the appropriate kernel headers to ensure that your module can communicate with the kernel properly. The headers are often included using the `#include` directive in C code.
    
5. **Location**: Kernel headers are usually found in the `/usr/include/linux` and `/usr/include/asm` directories on most Linux distributions. They can also be provided as part of a package specific to the kernel version you are using.
    
6. **Version Specific**: It's important to note that kernel headers are version-specific. You should use headers that match the version of the Linux kernel you are running or compiling against. Mismatched headers can lead to compatibility issues.
    

In summary, Linux headers are a set of source code files and header files that provide an interface between user-space applications and the Linux kernel. They are essential for software development on the Linux platform, especially when creating device drivers or other kernel-related software.
